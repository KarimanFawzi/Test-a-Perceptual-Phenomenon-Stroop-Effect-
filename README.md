# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon-Stroop-Effect-
This project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.
In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. I will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I will interpret my results in terms of my hypotheses
